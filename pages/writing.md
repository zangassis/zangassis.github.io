# My Writing career ‚úçüë®‚Äçüíº

I've always had an aptitude for writing, since elementary school, I loved to spend hours reading books, this gave me a great facility to interpret texts, something that helped me a lot in my software development career.

By combining my programming knowledge with writing, I found the perfect formula: **writing technical articles**.

That's why I'm always improving my writing by taking courses in that area, reading specialized websites and looking for topics that are relevant to the reading public.

## Tutorials üß©

As an experienced programmer, I write tutorial articles that help beginners understand complex subjects:

- [ASP.NET Core for Beginners: Web APIs](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/aspnet-core-beginners-web-apis) (Telerik)

- [Your First Microservice in .NET 6](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/your-first-microservice-dotnet-6) (Telerik)

## Tips ‚úÖ

Tips posts are great for improving a process and always get a good audience:

- [6 Tips for Writing Elegant C# Code](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/6-tips-writing-elegant-csharp-code) (Telerik)
- [Tips for More Efficient .NET Logs](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/tips-more-efficient-dotnet-logs) (Telerik)

## Day by day in the dev world üë®‚Äçüíª

Something I always do is reflect on the positives and negatives in the routine of a software developer and through that I write articles to help other people deal with the common problems of this vast universe.
